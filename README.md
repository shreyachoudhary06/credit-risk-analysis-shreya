## 📌 Project Overview

This is a **full end-to-end data analytics capstone project** simulating a real-world credit risk engagement at a bank or financial institution. As a Data Analyst, I received a brief from a panel of senior stakeholders — including a Chief Risk Officer, CFO, Credit Policy Team, and Loan Committee — each with critical, business-specific questions about their loan portfolio.

The result is a **4-phase analytical pipeline** starting from raw, uncleaned data and ending with a **5-page interactive Power BI dashboard** built on 32,407 loan records — designed to identify default patterns, quantify financial exposure, and enable data-driven lending decisions.

This project covers the **complete lifecycle of a data analyst's work**:

> `Raw Data → Excel Cleaning → MySQL Analysis → Statistical Insights → Power BI Dashboard`

## 🏢 Business Context — The Problem

A bank's credit risk leadership team identified several critical gaps in their loan portfolio visibility:

- 📉 **No unified default rate view** — leadership had no single number for overall portfolio health
- 🏷️ **Grade-level blindspot** — no visibility into which loan grades were generating most defaults
- 💸 **Unknown financial exposure** — CFO couldn't quantify total loan amount at risk from probable defaulters
- 🔍 **No borrower profiling** — credit policy team had no data-backed definition of a "safe" vs "danger" borrower
- 📊 **No statistical validation** — decisions were made on assumptions, not correlation or significance
- ⚠️ **No risk pricing analysis** — no way to verify whether interest rates were aligned with actual default risk per grade
- 🎚️ **No simulation capability** — no tool to model "what if we tighten lending criteria?"

---

## 🎯 Stakeholder Questions — Real World Business Brief

These are the exact questions posed by each stakeholder team. Every visual in the dashboard directly answers one or more of these questions.

### 👔 Chief Risk Officer (CRO)
1. *"What is our current portfolio default rate and how does it break down by risk grade?"*
2. *"Which combination of loan grade + loan intent creates the highest default concentration?"*
3. *"If a customer has defaulted before, is renting, and is applying for debt consolidation — what is their compounded default risk?"*

### 💰 CFO
4. *"What is the total loan amount at risk from high-probability defaulters?"*
5. *"Show me the interest rate spread between defaulters and non-defaulters — are we charging enough risk premium?"*
6. *"If we reject all applicants above a certain loan-to-income threshold — how much does our default rate drop?"*

### 📋 Loan Committee
7. *"Give me a full profile of our riskiest applicant segment — age, income, ownership, employment, intent, grade — on one screen."*
8. *"What % of our total loan portfolio sits in High Risk category and what is the total amount at risk?"*

### 📈 Data Analytics Team
9. *"Which single variable is the strongest statistical predictor of default?"*
10. *"At what loan-to-income ratio does default risk cross a critical threshold?"*
11. *"Does longer credit history actually protect against default, or is it statistically insignificant?"*
12. *"Are repeat defaulters concentrated in specific loan grades?"*

## ⭐ STAR Method

### 🔵 Situation
A bank's credit risk team had 32,000+ loan records across multiple risk grades, income brackets, and borrower profiles — but no analytical framework to identify default patterns, quantify financial exposure, or build a data-backed lending policy. The credit committee was making decisions on gut feeling, not data.

### 🟡 Task
Design and deliver a complete, production-grade analytical solution — from raw data cleaning through to an interactive Power BI dashboard — answering 12 stakeholder questions across credit risk, borrower demographics, financial impact, and portfolio simulation.

### 🟠 Action

**Phase 1 — Excel Data Cleaning:**
- ✅ Removed **165 duplicate rows** (0.5% of data) using Remove Duplicates
- ✅ Identified and removed **7 rows with impossible ages** (84, 94, 123, 144 years) — data entry errors
- ✅ Removed **2 rows with employment length = 123 years** — impossible value
- ✅ Flagged **8 income outliers above ₹10,00,000** with a new `income_outlier_flag` column rather than deleting — valid real-world scenarios
- ✅ Filled **3,116 missing `loan_int_rate` values** with median (10.99%) — median chosen over mean to avoid outlier influence
- ✅ Filled **887 missing `person_emp_length` values** with median (4.0 years)
- ✅ Created `loan_status_label` column: binary 0/1 → human-readable "Defaulted/Not Defaulted"
- ✅ Created `risk_category` column: grouped loan grades A=Low Risk, B/C=Medium Risk, D/E/F/G=High Risk
- ✅ Documented all changes in a dedicated `Cleaning_Log` sheet
- ✅ Preserved original raw data in `Raw_Data` sheet — professional data integrity standard

**Phase 2 — MySQL Analysis:**
- ✅ Imported cleaned CSV into MySQL Workbench (`credit_risk_db`)
- ✅ Wrote **10 business queries** covering default rates by grade, intent, ownership, age group, and prior history
- ✅ Used `COUNTIFS`, `GROUP BY`, `CASE WHEN`, `ROUND`, `DIVIDE` and window-style aggregations
- ✅ Built a compound risk query combining grade + intent + ownership in a single analysis

**Phase 3 — Statistical Analysis:**
- ✅ Computed **Pearson Correlation Coefficients** for all 7 numerical variables against loan default
- ✅ Performed **IQR-based outlier detection** on income, loan amount, and interest rate
- ✅ Built **descriptive statistics table** — count, mean, min, max, std dev, median for all numerical columns
- ✅ Created **defaulter vs non-defaulter comparative profile** using AVERAGEIF formulas in Excel
- ✅ Documented all 9 statistical findings with insights in a dedicated `Statistical_Findings` sheet

**Phase 4 — Power BI Dashboard:**
- ✅ Applied a fully custom **Credit Sentinel color theme** — manually configured dark navy background (`#0A0E1A`), gold titles (`#F59E0B`), red/blue/green accent system across all 5 pages
- ✅ Created a dedicated **`_Measures` table** to store all 15 DAX measures — professional BI development standard
- ✅ Wrote **15 DAX measures** including Default Rate %, Filtered Default Rate (What-If), and Avg Income by status
- ✅ Created **2 Power Query calculated columns** — `Age_Group` and `LTI_Bucket` — for demographic segmentation
- ✅ Built **Drill-Through** from any grade-level chart to a dedicated Grade Deep Dive page
- ✅ Built **2 Custom Tooltip Pages** — one for Loan Intent hover stats, one for Treemap grade detail
- ✅ Implemented a **What-If Parameter** for live loan-to-income threshold simulation
- ✅ Used **Conditional Formatting** with color scale rules across bar charts and matrix heatmaps
- ✅ Built a **Decomposition Tree** for interactive, free-form root cause exploration of default rate
- ✅ Designed a **Scorecard page** using only shapes and text boxes — comparing Safe vs Danger borrower profiles
- ✅ Added navigation buttons, back button, branding strip, and insight text boxes across all 5 pages

### 🟢 Result

| Metric | Finding |
|---|---|
| Overall Default Rate | **21.87%** — 1 in every 5 loans defaults |
| Top Predictor | Loan-to-income ratio — correlation **+0.38** |
| Grade G Default Rate | **98.44%** — nearly guaranteed default |
| Grade A Default Rate | **9.96%** — safest segment |
| Prior Default Impact | **2x higher** risk — 37.86% vs 18.44% |
| Renter Default Rate | **31.61%** vs Homeowners at 7.49% |
| Total Amount at Risk | **₹77M** from defaulted loans |
| Safe Portfolio | **₹234M** in non-defaulted loans |
| LTI Critical Threshold | Default rate jumps from **20.98% to 61.93%** after 30% LTI |
| Risk Pricing Gap | Interest rate rises slowly after Grade C while default rate spikes — bank **underpricing risk** on Grade D+ |

## 🏆 Key Business Findings

### ⭐ Top 5 Insights

```
1. OVERALL DEFAULT RATE
   21.87% of all applicants defaulted.
   1 in every 5 loans issued carries default risk.
   Total portfolio exposure: ₹77M in defaulted loans.

2. LOAN GRADE IS THE STRONGEST RISK INDICATOR
   Grade G loans default at 98.44% vs Grade A at only 9.96%.
   A 10x difference between safest and riskiest grade.
   Grades D and above should trigger mandatory credit review.

3. LOAN-TO-INCOME RATIO IS THE #1 STATISTICAL PREDICTOR
   Correlation of +0.38 — strongest of all 7 variables tested.
   Default rate jumps from 20.98% to 61.93% after 30% LTI.
   Critical threshold: Any LTI above 25% signals high risk.

4. PRIOR DEFAULT HISTORY = 2X RISK MULTIPLIER
   Applicants with prior default → 37.86% default rate.
   Clean history applicants → 18.44% default rate.
   Prior default on file must be a mandatory credit red flag.

5. HOME OWNERSHIP IS A STRONG PROTECTIVE FACTOR
   Homeowners default at only 7.49%.
   Renters default at 31.61% — 4.2x higher.
   Mortgage holders (12.62%) sit comfortably in between.

## 💡 Business Recommendation

> **Restrict lending** to Grade D+ borrowers with loan-to-income ratio above 25% and a prior default on file. These three factors combined represent the highest default concentration in the portfolio.
>
> **Focus portfolio growth** on OWN and MORTGAGE borrowers applying for Grade A–C loans with LTI below 20%. This segment shows default rates below 10% — the healthiest part of the portfolio.
>
> **Review interest rate pricing** on Grade D+ loans. The risk pricing analysis shows that interest rates rise slowly after Grade C while default rates spike — the bank may be undercharging for the true risk it is accepting on higher-grade loans.

## 🚀 How to Explore This Project

### Learn by Rebuilding It
If you are new to Excel, SQL, and Power BI, start with the [hands-on replica guide](docs/hands_on_replica_guide.md). It walks through cleaning a practice copy of the raw CSV, loading it into a separate MySQL learning schema, and building a Power BI report from the cleaned data. Keep the supplied finished files as references and do not overwrite them.

### Option 1 — Open in Power BI Desktop (Recommended)
1. **Download** `Credit_Risk_Dashboard.pbix` from this repository
2. **Install** Power BI Desktop (free) at [powerbi.microsoft.com](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/)
3. **Open** the `.pbix` file
4. **Explore** all 5 pages

> 💡 Power BI Desktop is completely free to download and use. No account required to view the dashboard.

### Option 2 — Explore the Data Yourself
1. Download `credit_risk_cleaned.csv`
2. Open in Excel or connect to your SQL database
3. Run the queries from `sql/credit_risk_analysis.sql`

For a separate, beginner-friendly MySQL setup and analysis script, use `sql/beginner_workshop.sql` together with the hands-on guide. It creates a `credit_risk_learning` schema and does not drop existing databases or tables.

### Try These Features in the Dashboard
- 🖱️ **Right-click** any grade bar on any page → **Drill Through** → Grade Deep Dive
- 🖱️ **Hover** over the Loan Intent column chart on Page 1 → Custom Tooltip appears
